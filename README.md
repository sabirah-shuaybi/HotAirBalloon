# HotAirBalloon

This program contains two classes: The __BalloonController__ class and the __HotAirBalloon__ class

The BallonController class is responsible for displaying a hot air balloon when the program starts. 
The class also defines mouse event handlers which allow the user to move the balloon up and down.
Furthermore, it creates a new hot air balloon at the location of user mouse click.
The color of each new hot air balloon clicked on to the screen is determined randomly.

The HotAirBalloon class is responsible for defining a blueprint for a hot air balloon object
This requires structuring, positioning and creating each of the individual hot air ballon parts relative to 
the location of mouse click. The class defines behaviors of a hot air balloon such as a randomColor, 
contains, moveVertical, darken and brighten methods for all instances of HotAirBalloon
