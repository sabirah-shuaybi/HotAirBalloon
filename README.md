# HotAirBalloon

This program contains two classes: The __BalloonController__ class and the __HotAirBalloon__ class

The BallonController class is responsible for displaying a hot air balloon when the program starts. 
The class also defines mouse event handlers which allow the user to move the balloon up and down.
Furthermore, it creates a new hot air balloon at the location of user mouse click.
The color of each new hot air balloon clicked on to the screen is determined randomly.
